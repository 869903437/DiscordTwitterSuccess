# Overview
This Discord.py bot will take channels in Discord and post the images sent there to Twitter. There are numerous customization options included. In order for this system to work, you will also need a Twitter developer account. You can apply for developer account access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/). This program offers a variety of setup options and configurations to affect styling of the messages. For more information and an in depth guide on how to set this up, visit the [tutorial links](https://github.com/HeroicosHM/DiscordTwitterSuccess#setup-tutorial) below.
